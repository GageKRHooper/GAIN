Grid-Based Adaptable Izhikevich Network

A research project that focuses on improving on the Izhikevich Model by making it more biologically plausible. This allows for a still pretty fast model that is more realistic. Showing extreme neighboring connections emerging. This has many uses that can be explored, and I am currently testing it with liquid neural networks
